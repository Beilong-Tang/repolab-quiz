    "description": "### Problem17\n\n\nThe binary search follows the recursive strategy from the mid=lo+(hi-lo)/2. There are two base cases: \n\n1. the search range is an empty range.\n\n2. the target number is at location __(0)\\__.\n\nIn the recursive step, if the target number is less than or equal to a[mid], then, it would look for the number in array index range [_____(1)\\___, _____(2)\\___) (hi/mid/lo); if not, look for the number in range [_____(3)\\___ +1 , _____(4)\\___) (hi/mid/lo).",
