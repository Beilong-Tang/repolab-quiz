    "description": "### Problem13\nS\u200buppose you want to add a constructor to Complex that takes a double value as its argument and creates a Complex number with that value as the real part (and imaginary part equal to 0). You write the following code:\n\n```java\npublic void Complex(double real)\n{\n    re = real;\n    im = 0.0;\n}\n```\n\nB\u200but then the statement Complex c = new Complex(1.0) does not compile. Why?\n\n**Choices:**\n\nT\u200bhe types of re and im are not declared.\n\nA\u200b class can only have one constructor.\n\nC\u200bonstructors do not have return types, not even void.\n\nT\u200bhe return type should be Complex, not void.\n\nN\u200bone of the above.",
