    "description": "### Problem14\n\nConsider a two-state DFA with a binary alphabet having the following transitions: Stay in state 0 if the input is 0 and stay in state 1 if the input is 1, otherwise switch to the other state. If state 0 is the accept state, which of the following does this DFA accept? \n\n**Choices:**\n\nA. Bitstrings with an equal number of occurrences of 0 and 1  \n\nB. Bitstrings with at least one 0 \n\nC. Bitstrings with an equal number of occurrences of 01 and 10  \n\nD. Bitstrings that end in 0  \n\nE. Bitstrings with more 0s than 1s  \n\n*From Coursera lecture slides <https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/lectures/keynote/CS.14.IntroTheory.pdf>* \n\n",
