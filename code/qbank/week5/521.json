    "description": "### Problem21\n\n\n> Deterministic finite-state automaton (DFA) is an abstract machine consists of:\n- A _____(0)\\___ number of states, each of which is designated as either an accept state or a reject state.\n- A set of _____(1)\\___ that specify how the machine changes state. Each state has one transition for each symbol in the alphabet.\n- A tape reader initially positioned at the first symbol of an input string and capable only of reading a symbol and moving to the next symbol.",
