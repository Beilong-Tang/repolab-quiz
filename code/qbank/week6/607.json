    "description": "### Problem07\n\n\nThis is a question from week6 lab material. \n\nThe incomplete Turing machine below is supposed to write onto its tape the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,..., but in unary notation: 1, 1, 11, 111, 11111, 11111111, 1111111111111. You will recall that each Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two. This Turing machine uses the symbols A, B ,and C to delineate the two most recently computed Fibonacci numbers. As usual, we omit transitions to the same state that do not change the symbol. Here is the tape before computing Fibonacci number 5, with the tape head positioned at the C:\n\n![image](/static/quiz/images/5.2.3.1fig.jpg)\n\nFill in exactly one symbol in each of the 4 empty squares below to complete the design of this Turing machine. To avoid worrying about initial conditi ons, you may assume that the initial contents of the tape and the position of the tape head are as given above and tha t the machine starts in the middle state, as indicated. Do not add new states or new transitions, and do not use tape symbols other than #, 0, 1, A, B, or C.\n\n![image](/static/quiz/images/5.2.3.2fig.jpg)\n\nHint: If we think a run of the TM starts at the starts at state marked L and ends at the same state, then configuration on the tape before the current one is:\n\n. . . # # # 1 A 1 B 1 1 C # # # . . . \n\nPlease write your answer here:  \n1: _____(0)\\___\n2: _____(1)\\___\n3: _____(2)\\___\n4: _____(3)\\___\n\n*Excerpt from Lab*",
