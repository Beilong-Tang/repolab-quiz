There does not exist an algorithm that solves arbitrary instances of TSP. \n\nB. There does not exist an algorithm that efficiently solves arbitrary instances of TSP.\n\nC. There exists an algorithm that efficiently solves arbitrary instances of TSP, but no one has been able to find it.\n\nD. TSP is not in P.  \n\nE.
