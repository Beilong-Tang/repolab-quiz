If the `write` line is 0 and `input` value is 1, then the `output` will be 1.\n\nb. If the `write` line is 0 and `input` value is 1, then the `output` will can be either 1 or 0.\n\nc. The current `output` of the register bit is 1. if we first change the `write` line from 0 to 1, and then change the `input` value from 0 to 1, the `output` will be 1 for all the time (*assume the time interval between each change is enough to reach a stable state*).\n\nd. The current `output` of the register bit is 1. if we first change the `input` value from 0 to 1, and then change the `write` line from 0 to 1, the `output` will be 1 for all the time (*assume the time interval between each change is enough to reach a stable state*).\n\n*Excerpt From Computer Science Sedgewick, Robert,Wayne, Kevin.
