MAJ (x,y,z) is 1 if the majority of x, y, and z is 1.\n\n\nPlease select the following choices that are correct:\n\n**Choices:**\n\na. Every boolean function can be represented with an expression using AND, OR and NOT operators.\n\nb. MAJ (x, y, z) = x'y'z + x'yz' + xy'z' + xyz \n\nc. Any boolean function can be represented as a sum of products of its arguments and negation.\n\nd.
