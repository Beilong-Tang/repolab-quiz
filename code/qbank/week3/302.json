    "description": "### Problem02\nLook at the following two Java functions:\n\n```java\npublic static double recursive_harmonic(int n )\n    {\n        if(n==1) return 1.0;\n        return recursive_harmonic(n-1)+1.0/n;\n    }\n\npublic static double not_recursive_harmonic(int n )\n    {\n        double value=0;\n        for (int i =1;i<=n;i++)\n        {\n            value+=1.0/i;\n        }\n        return value;\n    }\n```\nPlease select choices that are correct.\n\n**Choices:**\n\na. The 'recursive_harmonic()' takes exactly the same memory space as the 'not_recursive_harmonic()' method.\n\nb. There are situations when iteration (loop) is the only option rather than recursion that is avalibable to address a problem. \n\nc. Any recursive function can be replaced by an iterative counterpart.\n\nd. System keeps track of each recursive call in Java using a data structure called stack.\n\n_Excerpt From\nComputer Science\nSedgewick, Robert,Wayne, Kevin.\nThis material may be protected by copyright._\n\n",
