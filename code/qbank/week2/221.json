    "description": "### Problem21\nPlease select the choices that are correct.\n\n**Choices:**\n\na. In Java, we cannot use public static methods definded in another class.\n\nb. There are two '.java' files in a directory. One is called 'A.java', and the other is called 'B.java'. In 'A.java', there is a public static method called 'sum()'. In 'B.java', we can call the 'sum()' function defined in 'A.java' by writing 'A.sum()' in 'B.java'.\n\nc. In Java, if a static method is 'private', we cannot call the static method in another class.\n\nd. There are only two '.java' files in a directory. One is called 'A.java', and the other is called 'B.java'. In 'A.java', it calls one static method in 'B.java'. When we do 'javac A.java', there will only be one class file generated which is 'A.class'.\n\ne. Imagine we have two '.java' files under the same directory, which are 'Add.java' and 'Subtract.java'. Both '.java' files have their own main() method. The 'Subtract.java' uses the function defined in the 'Add.java'. When we run 'Subtract.java', the main() method in 'Add.java' will also be run.\n\n*Excerpt From Computer Science Sedgewick, Robert,Wayne, Kevin. This material may be protected by copyright.*\n\n",
