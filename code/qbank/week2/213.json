    "description": "### Problem13\n\nFunctions, which are known as _____(0)\\___ _____(1)\\___ in java, are important because they allow us to clearly separate tasks within a program and because they provide general mechanism that enables us to reuse code (literally from sec-2.1).\n\nLook at the following code:\n\n```java\n1   public static double harmonic (int n)\n2   {\n3       double sum =0.0\n4       for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) sum += 1.0/i;\n5       return sum;\n6   }\n```\n\nThe first line is called a _____(2)\\___ of the function. The \"double\" in the first line is called the _____(3)\\___ _____(4)\\___ of the function (literally from an image of sec-2.1). Can we use the \"sum\" defined in the harmonic function in our main() method? Answer:_____(5)\\___ (y/n).\n\n*Excerpt From Computer Science Sedgewick, Robert,Wayne, Kevin.
